#### Azure disk could not be resized when it's in "attached" state, we could only resize azure disk when it's in "unattached" state, this page will show you how to achieve this.

**How to use azure disk size grow feature**
 > available from `v1.11.0`, details: [Add azuredisk PV size grow feature](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64386)
 - In the beginning, pls make sure the azure disk PVC is created by `kubernetes.io/azure-disk` storage class with `allowVolumeExpansion: true` (default is false)
```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: hdd
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  skuname: Standard_LRS
  kind: Managed
  cachingmode: None
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```
 - Before run `kubectl edit pvc pvc-azuredisk` operation, pls make sure this PVC is not mounted by any pod, otherwise there would be resize error. There are a few ways to achieve this, wait a few minutes for the PVC disk detached from the node after below operation:
   - option#1: change the replica count to 0, this will terminate the pod and detach the disk
   - option#2: cordon all nodes and then delete the original pod, this will make the pod in pending state

**Make sure the only pod is terminated from the agent node, otherwise may hit `VolumeResizeFailed` when edit disk PVC**

Now run `kubectl edit pvc pvc-azuredisk` to change azuredisk PVC size from 6GB to 10GB

 - After resized, run `kubectl describe pvc pvc-azuredisk` to check PVC status:

```

 - Create a pod mounting with this PVC, you will get
```
$ kubectl exec -it nginx-azuredisk -- bash
# df -h

Note: [volume expansion feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims) is beta in v1.11
